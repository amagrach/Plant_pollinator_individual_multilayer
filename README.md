Data and code for: Untangling the feedbacks and functional consequences of changing community composition and pollinator foraging patterns

Summary
The raw data is available in the /data folder, in .csv files that contain the information needed to create visitation sequences, steps and triplets for our empirical examples. Every other manipulation is stored in the /results folder.

All results and figures from the study are already generated in the relevant folders. To re-run the analyses, run each script in order. Scripts with prefix 1 are used to run the foraging movement analyses; scripts with prefix 2 are used to estimate the average pollinator effectiveness in our study systems; scripts with prefix 3 calculate the number of homospecific and heterospecific triplets per week; and, finally, scripts with prefix 4 are use to perform the reproduction success analyses.
